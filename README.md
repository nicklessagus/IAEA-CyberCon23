This repository is a complement to the paper *"Classification of Cyberattacks Applying Machine Learning Techniques in CNEA Network Infrastructure"* presented at #IAEA-CyberCon23. 
It shows a practical application of clustering on requests to a proxy server.  
In the *data* folder there are files with all the different stages of data transformation from the apache log format, as detailed in the article, and among the normal accesses there are attacks and the challenge is to try to find them using a clustering technique. 
It is sufficiently guided so that you don't need a lot of knowledge in Machine Learning, just a little bit of Python.
